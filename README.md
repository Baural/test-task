##Test task
Please write a Java application which provides a service for indexing text files.

The console interface should allow for 
* (i) specifying the indexed files and directories and
* (ii) querying files containing a given word.
  
The library should be extensible by the tokenization algorithm (simple splitting by words/support lexers/etc.). 

State persistence between running sessions is not needed. 

Providing some tests and a program with usage examples is advised.

## Use case
After indexing files 
put numbers or/and words. 


Service looking for words separatelly  in indexed files.
